A light-featured minecraft mod that adds two items. The **Calming Candle** and **Raging Candle**.

<br>Calming Candle:

Gives every entity in a 20 block radius the Calm effect. Entities with the calm effect will act as passive mobs. They will never attack even if provoked.

<br>Raging Candle:

Gives every entity in a 20 block radius the Rage effect. Entities with the rage effect are hostile to **ALL** entities. This leads to mob infighting and aggressive passive mobs.

This is my first released Minecraft Mod! Let me know if there are any gamebreaking bugs!

I got the idea of effect candles from Befoul by Luxintrus and also Candles from the Calamity Mod for Terraria.
I thought I came up with the Rage effect myself but im pretty sure its from a RAT video.
